<h1>Design Principles</h1>
<hr>
<span class="subtitle mda-font--18">
  Universal beliefs validated and scientifically contrasted that affect the human being and his relationship with
  physical and digital objects, as well as with the world around him. They are based on immutable aspects and when they
  are present and consolidated, good design is born.

    <h2>Keep it Simple</h2>
    <hr>
    Good design emphasises the usefulness of a product: the simpler we make our designs, the faster and easier it is for
    users to make decisions. Use streamlined interactions and comprehensive UI to bring focus and clarity to user’s
    core action and information. Making something simple to use is much harder -especially when the underlying systems
    are complex- but that’s the challenge of Stratio products.

    <h2>Be Consistent</h2>
    <hr>
    Use interaction patterns, layout and typography in a consistent way, this helps with usability, and how users
    perceive the software (efficient and professional). Use whenever possible our framework components and patterns over
    specific module design element. Maximize productivity and consistency, sharing and reusing instead of reinventing
    the wheel every time. Use and maintain this cohesive system.

    <h2>Give Feedback</h2>
    <hr>
    Implement feedback through notifications, alerts, options and other visual aids, either automatically or according
    to the user's requests. Provides real-time notification of process status, it makes users feel in control and
    increase confidence that the task is proceeding and working as intended.

    <h2>Prioritize Data Visualization</h2>
    <hr>
    Stratio product is built around data. This must be reflected through interfaces with a focus on data legibility,
    with visual solutions  sparing use of bold and bright colours to get attention on data above a neutral background.
    Besides, use color coding to convey information quickly, that facilitates visual search.
  </div>
  <div class="principle__unit">
    <h2>Be Scalable</h2>
    <hr>
    Design considering multiple scenarios. Value flexible, scalable solutions that can evolve easily with the content.
  </div>
  <div class="principle__unit">
    <h2>Make it Agile</h2>
    <hr>
    Use design solutions to make our product feel responsive and fast, reflecting our brand. Make it also easy and
    agile to build and maintain.
  </div>
  <div class="principle__unit">
    <h2>Think Modularly</h2>
    <hr>
    Design components and layouts with an awareness of all the use cases and places they may show up. Be aware of
    content dimensions and screen sizes.
  </div>
  <div class="principle__unit">
    <h2>Focus on details</h2>
    <hr>
    We are care about how our applications look and feel because attractive interfaces have an impact on perceived
    usability. When the UI has been polished and copywriting is absolutely clear (with context and zero ambiguity), it
    builds trust with users.
