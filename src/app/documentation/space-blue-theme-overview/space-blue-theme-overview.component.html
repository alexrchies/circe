<h1>The Stratio official theme: Space Blue</h1>
<hr>
<span class="subtitle mda-font--18">
  The Space Blue theme is the official theme for the Stratio products. This theme is based on the color palette the Space
  shows along the hours, from the almost white on a sunny day to cloudy light gray or the dark blue of the night.
</span>

<p>
  Complementing this palette, we use a series of colors that allow us to create accents related, usually, with item status.
</p>

<p>
  The idea under this design is creating applications as clear and clean as possible that uses colors to indicate
  information that guides the user visually to the data that is really important for it.
