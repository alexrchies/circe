<h2>Multi-theme architecture</h2>
<p>
  The default theme provided by the SDS is the one used by the Stratio products and it is the one you can see on the demo.
  However, this theme is only a demonstration. Thanks to its multi-theming architecture, the whole look & feel can be adapted to
  any other appearance needs.
