<h1>Theme: Overview</h1>
<hr>
<span class="subtitle mda-font--18">
  A theme is an editable template that allows the user to modify some graphic items of the appearance of the components.
  The Stratio Design System is template-based so most of its graphic properties can be modified to adapt the appearance
  to any other look & feel requirements.

<h2>Multi-theme</h2>

<p>
  The default theme provided by the SDS is the one used by the Stratio products and it is the one you can see on the demo.
  However, the whole components developed by Stratio are ready to be customized with any other combination of colors, fonts,
  or even other details like border radious and spacings.
</p>

<p>
  This flexibility is part of our way of thinking on the develop and design world. Develop once, customize as you want,
  deploy as you need.

<h2>The Stratio official theme: Sky Blue</h2>

<p>
  The Sky Blue theme is the official theme for the Stratio products. This theme is based on the color palette the sky
  shows along the hours, from the almost white on a sunny day to cloudy light gray or the dark blue of the night.
</p>

<p>
  Complementing this palette, we use a series of colors that allow us to create accents related, usually, with item status.
</p>

<p>
  The idea under this design is creating applications as clear and clean as possible that uses colors to indicate
  information that guides the user visually to the data that is really important for it.
