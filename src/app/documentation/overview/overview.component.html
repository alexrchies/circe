<span class="subtitle mda-font--18">
  Universal beliefs validated and scientifically contrasted that affect the human being and his relationship with
  physical and digital objects, as well as with the world around him. They are based on immutable aspects and when they
  are present and consolidated, good design is born.

    <h2>Keep it Simple</h2>
    <hr>
    Good design emphasises the usefulness of a product: the simpler we make our designs, the faster and easier it is for
    users to make decisions. Use streamlined interactions and comprehensive UI to bring focus and clarity to user’s
    core action and information. Making something simple to use is much harder -especially when the underlying systems
    are complex- but that’s the challenge of Stratio products.

    <h2>Give Feedback</h2>
    <hr>
    Implement feedback through notifications, alerts, options and other visual aids, either automatically or according
    to the user's requests. Provides real-time notification of process status, it makes users feel in control and
    increase confidence that the task is proceeding and working as intended.

    <h2>Prioritize Data Visualization</h2>
    <hr>
    Stratio product is built around data. This must be reflected through interfaces with a focus on data legibility,
    with visual solutions  sparing use of bold and bright colours to get attention on data above a neutral background.
    Besides, use color coding to convey information quickly, that facilitates visual search.

    <h2>Be Scalable</h2>
    <hr>
    Design considering multiple scenarios. Value flexible, scalable solutions that can evolve easily with the content.
    This principle ensures that the products designed can grow over time.

    <h2>Design for error prevention</h2>
    <hr>
    An error is defined as an incorrect user action that prevents you from achieving the desired goal.
    The system must be prepared to avoid or prevent them.
    There are many types of errors that can be classified according to their impact.

    <h2>Focus on details</h2>
    <hr>
    We care about how our applications look and feel because attractive interfaces have an impact on perceived
    usability. When the UI has been polished and copywriting is absolutely clear (with context and zero ambiguity), it
    builds trust with users.
