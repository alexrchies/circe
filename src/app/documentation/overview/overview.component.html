<h1>Overview</h1>

<span class="subtitle mda-font--18">
  A theme is an editable template that allows the user to modify some graphic items of the appearance of the components.
  The Stratio Design System is template-based so most of its graphic properties can be modified to adapt the appearance
  to any other look & feel requirements.

<h2>Customizable components</h2>

<p>
  The whole components developed by Stratio are ready to be customized with any other combination of colors, fonts,
  or even other details like border radious and spacings.
</p>

<p>
  This flexibility is part of our way of thinking on the develop and design world. Develop once, customize as you want,
  deploy as you need.
