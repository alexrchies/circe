        This atomic parts are the foundation of the Design System.<br><br>
        They work as developer variables. They are the only thing you need to change in case you want another
        kind of design!

        Components are the core of the designs of your product. Buttons, inputs, dropdowns... they depend on Tokens. So
        if you need to change the design of them, just change the tokens and voil√°, all components are changed
        in a second.

        Patterns are groups of components that usually are repetitive.<br><br>
        They help you to build your product in a consistent way.  Best patterns examples are Cards, Forms, blog
        posts, sidebars, menus, etc.

        Templates are page structures that are commonly used. Use pre-made templates to not start from scratch your
        designs and development. This speeds up the starting process of designing and coding a new product screen.
